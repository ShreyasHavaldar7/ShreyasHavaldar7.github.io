So, quarantine resulted in me getting back to reading. I began the quarantine by reading Agatha Christie's **Murder of Roger Acryod** and George Orwell's **1984**. More on these later. Presently, I'm concurrently reading Haruki Murakami's **Norwegian Wood** and Agatha Christie's **Death on the Nile**. So **Norwegian Wood** turned out pretty weird. I was not accustomed to reading such grim books and this surely was a very incorrect time to start such a book. I did complete it and what struck me the most was how matter-of-factly Murakami presented life changing events, like death. Perhaps more on this in a full review. **Death on the Nile** turned out to be pretty predictable in the end and was not impressed. Did not help that the previous Agatha Christie I read was perhaps her best work. **To kill a mockingbird** is what I'm reading now. Seems very highly rated. ALso, **Hyperbole and a Half** is perhaps the most relatable book I've ever read. Given that it's a day worth of reading, surely worth a shot. On this note, I plan to maintain a seperate section to list books I've liked and would recommend. Lets see how that turns out to be.
