My internship concluded and it was a pretty fun experience, something productive arose out of the otherwise very lethargic lockdown. Got me involved into the fine details of commercial implementations of the segmentation models. I'm back to exploring the robustness domain now.

Last few weeks were pretty fun, exciting final week of the Premier League where Chelsea eventually did get the CL spot. The FA up final was pretty frustrating, bad injuries and debatable refereeing made did not help.

This week brings UCL, followed by US Open in the end of the month. Should be pretty intense given how close spaced the matches are. US Open 2020 would be the first one wihout Nadal or Federer since 1999, but hey some Tennis is better than no Tennis.
