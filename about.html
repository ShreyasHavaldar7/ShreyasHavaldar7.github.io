        I currently work at <a target="blank" href="https://research.google/teams/india-research-lab/">Google Research India</a> as a Pre-Doctoral Researcher in the Advertising Sciences team, mentored by <a target="blank" href="https://research.google/people/107631/">Dr. Aravindan Raghuveer</a>, <a target="blank" href="https://sites.google.com/view/karthikeyan-shanmugam">Dr. Karthikeyan Shanmugam</a> and <a target="blank" href="https://research.google/people/107857/">Dr. Rishi Saket</a>. My work focuses on developing fair algorithms, especially under distribution shifts and developing scalable models for learning from aggregate data and privacy afforded by such aggregations.

        I've also been a member of <a target="blank" href= "https://lab1055.github.io/">Machine Learning and Vision Lab Group @ IIT Hyderabad</a> headed by <a target="blank" href="https://www.iith.ac.in/~vineethnb/index.html">Dr. Vineeth N Balasubramanian.</a> I've worked on applications of Influence Functions and the extensions to interpretability and explainability of models. I explored the robustness domain, and read and presented work from various domains across the AI space, especially <strong>Computer Vision</strong>. I have dabbled in a multitude of Computer Science Research Areas and have had the pleasure to work with <a target="blank" href= "https://people.iith.ac.in/rogers/">Dr. Rogers Mathew</a> for my Honors Thesis on Studying and investigating special cases union‑closed families to obtain insight about the union‑closed conjecture and studying and obtaining bounds
sizes of families possessing properties like L‑intersection closedness, with <a target="blank" href= "https://people.iith.ac.in/mvp/">Prof. M.V. Panduranga Rao</a> on experimenting with different allocation strategies to mitigate the effects of noise on the performance of a Quantum Algorithm, and with <a target="blank" href= "https://people.iith.ac.in/karteek/">Dr. Karteek Sreenivasaiah</a> studying and obtaining complexity bounds for algorithms obtaining Nash Equilibrium for games. I have also occasionally enagaged myself in <strong>Dev projects.</strong> </p>

        When I'm not reading, I'm
        <ul>
            <li>watching Tennis and Football and Cricket matches, and newly F1, analysis and everything else that surrounds these beautiful sports. During the quarantine, this chunk has certainly grown alot. If you are a Djokovic or a Chelsea fan, how do I not know you already!</li>
            <li>quizzing and creating quizzes, debating, and binging random shows parallely heading The Literary Society, IITH</li>
         </ul>

        I've represented IIT Hyderabad at <strong>Nihilanth</strong>, the Inter-IIT-IIM Quiz Championship, held at IIM Calcutta in January 2019, and at <strong>The Inter IIT Cultural Meet</strong> held at IIT Bombay in Decmber 2019, and at <strong>The Inter IIT Tech Meet</strong> held by IIT Guwahati in March 2021. Those were couple of most exciting weekends of my life, a congregation of some of the most interesting bunch of amazing people.
