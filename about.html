        I currently work at <a target="blank" href="https://research.google/teams/india-research-lab/">Google Research India</a> as a Pre-Doctoral Researcher in the Advertising Sciences team, mentored by <a target="blank" href="https://research.google/people/107631/">Dr. Aravindan Raghuveer</a>, <a target="blank" href="https://sites.google.com/view/karthikeyan-shanmugam">Dr. Karthikeyan Shanmugam</a> and <a target="blank" href="https://research.google/people/107857/">Dr. Rishi Saket</a>. My work focuses on developing fair algorithms, especially under distribution shifts and developing scalable models for learning from aggregate data and privacy afforded by such aggregations.

        I have worked at <a target="blank" href= "https://www.adobe.com/">Adobe Big Data Experience Lab</a> mentored by <a target="blank" href= "https://research.adobe.com/person/anandhavelu-n/">Anandhavelu Natarajan</a> and <a target="blank" href= "https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharmila-reddy-nangi/">Sharmila Reddy Nangi</a> as a <strong>Research Intern</strong> for the summer of 2021, where I ideated and implemented novel techniques for improving <strong>tagging</strong> for <strong>accessibility</strong> using interactive <strong>human feedback</strong>}. Earlier I worked as a <strong>Machine Learning Intern</strong> at <a target="blank" href= "https://www.jiw.co.jp/">Japan Infra Waymark Corp.</a> with <a target="blank" href= "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37087993184"> Arifumi Matsumoto</a> in the summer of 2020 where I researched, improved, and deployed SOTA <strong>semantic segmentation</strong> models for datasets derived from <strong>aerial imagery</strong>

        I've also been a member of <a target="blank" href= "https://lab1055.github.io/">Machine Learning and Vision Lab Group @ IIT Hyderabad</a> headed by <a target="blank" href="https://www.iith.ac.in/~vineethnb/index.html">Dr. Vineeth N Balasubramanian.</a> I've worked on applications of Influence Functions and the extensions to interpretability and explainability of models. I explored the robustness domain, and read and presented work from various domains across the AI space, especially <strong>Computer Vision</strong>. I have dabbled in a multitude of Computer Science Research Areas and have had the pleasure to work with <a target="blank" href= "https://people.iith.ac.in/rogers/">Dr. Rogers Mathew</a> for my Honors Thesis on Studying and investigating special cases union‑closed families to obtain insight about the union‑closed conjecture and studying and obtaining bounds
sizes of families possessing properties like L‑intersection closedness, with <a target="blank" href= "https://people.iith.ac.in/mvp/">Prof. M.V. Panduranga Rao</a> on experimenting with different allocation strategies to mitigate the effects of noise on the performance of a Quantum Algorithm, and with <a target="blank" href= "https://people.iith.ac.in/karteek/">Dr. Karteek Sreenivasaiah</a> studying and obtaining complexity bounds for algorithms obtaining Nash Equilibrium for games. I have also occasionally enagaged myself in <strong>Dev projects.</strong>, and had redesigned and developed the <a target="blank" href= "https://www.iith.ac.in/">official website of IIT Hyderabad</a> as a static site to improve speed, prevent malicious attacks. </p>

            <li>quizzing and conducting quizzes, debating, and binging random shows</li>
            <li>exploring new places, new activities, and learning random facts about randomest things under and beyond the sun </li>

        I love giving back to the society in whatever way I can, be it through tutoring underprivileged children or developing reading material for the disadvantaged. Multiple Teaching Assistantships at Google Research, NPTEL and IIT Hyderabad have helped me gain invaluable experience, learning the subjects itself better and learning how to help people learn. No doubt, the best way to learn is to teach. I also believe it is important to be a contributor to the Research Community and have reviewed and volunteered for Conferences.

        I've represented IIT Hyderabad at <strong>Nihilanth</strong>, the Inter-IIT-IIM Quiz Championship, held at IIM Calcutta in January 2019, and at <strong>The Inter IIT Cultural Meet</strong> held at IIT Bombay in Decmber 2019, and at <strong>The Inter IIT Tech Meet</strong> held by IIT Guwahati in March 2021. Those were couple of most exciting weekends of my life, a congregation of some of the most interesting bunch of amazing people.
